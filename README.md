# Project Introduction

Cooking and coding, two seemingly distinct domains, can intertwine to create something truly captivating. In this comprehensive guide, we're about to embark on a journey where gastronomy meets technology. Together, we'll delve into the art of designing and developing a digital recipe book using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, spiced up with the integration of a Food & Recipe API.

In the digital age, everything has gone online, recipes included. Think about it â€“ no more flipping through worn-out cookbooks or deciphering handwritten recipe cards. Imagine a user-friendly digital recipe book that not only presents recipes with mouthwatering images but also allows for interactivity. That's exactly what we'll be building together.

# HTML Code

This HTML code represents the structure of a simple web page for a Recipe Book App. Here's a breakdown of each part:

1. Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`):

    This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. In this case, it's HTML5.

2. HTML Tag (`<html lang="en">`):

    Root element of the HTML document.

    `lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the document as English.

    This tag indicates the beginning of the HTML document and specifies the language of the content, which is English in this case.

3. Head Section (`<head>`): 

    Contains metadata about the document.

    The head section of the document contains metadata about the webpage, like character encoding, title, stylesheets, and other resources. It doesn't display directly on the webpage.

    Meta tags (`<meta>`):

      `charset="UTF-8"` declares the character encoding of the document as UTF-8.  This sets the character encoding of the document to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters and symbols from different languages.

      `http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"` provides instructions to Internet Explorer on which rendering engine to use. This meta tag tells Internet Explorer to use the latest rendering engine available.

      `name="viewport"` sets the viewport width to the device's width and initial zoom level to 1.  This meta tag ensures that the webpage is properly scaled and displayed on various devices, adapting to different screen sizes.
       

    Title (`<title>`): Specifies the title of the document.

    External CSS (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />`): Links an external CSS file named "styles.css" to style the HTML content.

4. Body Section (`<body>`):

    Contains the content of the document.

    Header (`<header>`): Typically contains introductory content like a heading or logo.

    Heading (`<h1>`): Displays the main heading of the application.

    Container (`<div class="container">`): Contains the main content of the application.

    Unordered List (`<ul id="recipe-list" class="recipe-list">`): Displays the list of recipes.

    External JavaScript (`<script src="script.js"></script>`): Links an external JavaScript file named "script.js" to provide dynamic functionality to the application.
